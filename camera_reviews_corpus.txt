I'm not sure why this camera is getting such glowing reviews.|0
As a point-and-shoot for daytime vacation photos, this camera is perfectly serviceable.|0
At nighttime, or under any kind of challenging conditions (such as a concert), the camera is SLOW as molasses to take pictures, and the pictures are often washed out or out of focus.|1
On vacation in Europe I took (no joke) 50+ pictures of the Grand Place in Brussels at night, and NOT ONE came out decently - all were extremely grainy or horribly out of focus, or both.|1
However, pictures I took with my cell phone came out fine (given that it was a 5MP camera on a $79 phone).|0
Also, pictures I took with my GF's *cheaper* Canon P&S looked fine.|0
So it's not entirely me.|0
I also took this camera with me to a recent CHVRCHES concert: despite being less than 30 feet from the stage, the pics I took with this camera are AWFUL - the pics taken with the 8MP camera on my (new) phone look a hundred times better.|0
It's almost as if the firmware is somehow off on this camera or something.|0
All I know is, this is my fourth digital P&S camera, and this is the worst one BY FAR - even the godawful HP digital camera I owned back in 2002 took better low-light pictures than this camera.|0
Also, the battery latch has a nasty habit of popping open in my pocket, something that's never once happened with the HP and Canon cameras I've owned in the past.|1
I read on an article that this is a good camera.|0
Nope.|0
I bought this camera for my trip to Thailand but it takes such bad pictures to the point where I just leave it behind.|0
I ended up using my phone because it takes much better picture.|0
Any slight movement when taking the picture of result in a lifetime of missed memories because the picture will come out very blurry.|1
Such an awful camera.|0
I am never going to buy a cheap camera again.|0
I guess I could give this to some or donate it.|0
First photo is with Sony Second photo is with New Canon SX 520 HS $89 (16 megapixel) Third photo is with old Canon Powershot SD 100 (7.1 megapixel) , my dog moved during the third photo I usually only purchase items after reading multiple reviews.|0
I was tricked by the amount of good vs. poor reviews on this camera.|0
Even though the specs are pretty good 20.1 megapixel, optical zoom, etc, the pictures produced were less than ideal.|0
It was far inferior to the pictures taken with my Canon Powershot purchased 10 years ago.|0
That camera had much lower specs.|0
Without the flash, the pictures are extremely blurry.|1
With the blinding flash (which I was afraid would cause my 1 yr old niece retinal damage, so I decided to stop taking pictures during her birthday party :( ) the pictures were only slightly better.|1
I even tried taking pictures outside when it was bright and sunny but that still did not help with my picture quality.|0
I'm not a photography expert or anything, which is why I rely on specs and online reviews. |0
All I want is a point and shoot camera that worked maybe slightly better than my old camera.|0
I should have checked other review website before deciding to purchase this camera.|0
I regret purchasing this $89 paperweight.|0
I tried returning this product or trading it in.|0
Apparently no website, including Amazon trade in, will accept this product.|0
I know why.|0
Ugh.|0
Returned item, extremely limited menu options, focus is slow so it doesn't take pictures fast enough (my phone was faster), build quality is very cheap I thought It was going to break when opening the battery hatch, and to top it off the charging cable is SONY PROPRIETARY, Why on earth is it not USB??|1
Terrible for travel if all of your gear is USB...except for this darn thing.|0
I've had a lot of Sony cameras in the past and they were great..but this model is a joke.|0
I had a similar Sony camera that gave out after almost ten years of use.|0
I wanted something as similar as possible to my old one, and this looked, on paper, to fit the bill.|0
However, in ten years the quality has gone downhill.|0
This is more shoddily made, and the picture quality was worse despite a higher pixel count.|1
It's small and portable, but the picture quality was very low (compared to the similar camera I had owned and other cameras produced today.)|1
The shutter speed was awful, so I was consistently frustrated taking pictures of family and friends--which is why I bought the camera!|1
If you really don't expect much, it's ok, but spending a little more--or, as I did, spending *LESS* on an older model--yielded much higher quality photos.|0
I've had it a little over a year, now the Image Stabilization has Parkinson's..|0
It's saying there is shaking even when on something stable, and ADDS massive blur to the picture.|1
Terrific.|0
I might use it once every few months, maybe took a few hundred pictures with it.|0
Oh well, guess it's a cheap throwaway (even though $100 is pretty damn steep for that).|0
I attached a pic of what it now looks like when I take a picture as still as I can be.|0
We've owned several Sony point and shoots over the years.|0
This one was a big disappointment.|0
We figured that the price was so low due to the improvement in phone cameras.|0
But this was cheap because it is built rather cheap.|1
The photo quality was average to poor, and it just feels like a $100 camera that it is.|1
We don't use it anymore, and either use our phones, or take our Nikon DLSR with us.|0
This particular Sony is sitting the bench.|0
I don't recommend unless you are looking for a cheap extra camera and photo quality is not that important to you.|0
Lasted only several weeks of indoor use, then error on power-up.|1
Warranty claim took more than 2 months to process (actually, it's still not resolved because I'm still waiting for the buy back check Sony promised).|0
I had to call Sony after many weeks of no status updates.|0
Then they say they can't fix it and will refund my money since Sony can't provide that same model as a replacement anymore.|0
While it was working, picture quality was not very good, but I didn't expect much given the price.|1
I am a real estate appraiser and I don't like to carry a big, expensive, or heavy camera.|0
I take all my photos in the lowest resolution for internet transport and I take lots of photos both inside and outside in every condition from very low to bright light.|0
My last camera was a cheap Samsung which I bought at Costco for like $100 and it worked great until the battery/SD card hinged cover broke off.|0
I'm very disappointed in this Sony camera.|0
It is almost impossible to get a good photo inside or outside.|0
Every photo comes out dark and I have to lighten it which makes it look washed out.|1
I will be returning it and buying a Canon based on this link [...]and the recommendation.|0
Found one here on Amazon for a little more than this piece of junk cost me. Hope it works!|0
Bought this to replace my 6 year old Fuji Finepix which had done sterling service, but was beginning to look it's age and photos were looking a bit blurry in comparison to those taken on my phone.|0
Thinking that great strides must have been made since buying the Fuji, I read up on all the point & shoot models, and mainly due to the many glowing reviews decided on this one.|0
I really wish I hadn't bothered.|0
As mentioned by other reviewers, the picture quality is acceptable for close ups but the zoom is basically useless; and the painfully slow shutter speed means that you end up with a load of photos you don't want because they've all been taken about 10 seconds too late!|1
Picture quality is really no better than it's predecessor and at least it took the pics I wanted.|0
On the plus side it's very light and slim and fits easily into a pocket or bag, but I think this will be heading for the charity box.|0
in taking video: blurs the video every few seconds.|1
totally unexplained...there was no movement distortion as it was stabilized on a tripod.|0
Happened every time video was shot.|0
Of course it was returned.|0
I used this a few times for biking.|0
Great for still shots, not so great for moving/action shots.|0
Even the still shots sometimes look a little crumby.|1
The only advantage this camera has over an iphone 6s is the zoom quality.|0
I've actually resorted back to using my phone for its ease of use.|0
I returned the first camera because it stopped working after one day.|0
It was replaced in September and although most of my pictures were out of focus, I assumed I was the problem and needed to learn more.|0
Had to postpone using it because of family member's heath needs until the past week.|0
Over the Christmas holidays, I took many pictures at family gatherings.|0
Almost every picture is blurred and has to be discarded.|1
It is too late to get a solution and there seems to be no solution offered.|0
This camera is absolutely horrible!|0
Yes, it can fit in my pocket, which is nice.|0
Yes, it doesn't require batteries.|0
But that's as far as the good qualities go.|0
All the pictures I take are dark, dingy, and blurry.|1
I've read the manual and changed the settings - nothing improves the crappy quality of the photos.|0
I'm not asking for anything super fancy or HD, I just want a decent, non-blurry picture of my family on vacation.|0
The video is horrible as well. I like that there is no time limit on how long the video can be, but it doesn't matter when the image goes in and out of focus the entire video.|1
This was the biggest waste of money!!!|0
I'm so disappointed.|0
I hate this camera so much that I wouldn't even re-sell to somebody at a reduced price.|0
This is a utility camera.|0
If you need something you don't care much about for work, or basic use, it's OK.|0
I buy cameras like this because I don't want to ruin my phone or a quality camera when I take pictures at work, and as such this camera is more or less adequate.|0
I think it's overpriced for what it is, but there aren't many that cost less either.|0
I've gone through a lot of $50-$100 digital cameras in the past years, and for how I use them they never last more than a year, if that.|0
It's annoying and frustrating, but frankly I am very hard on them and I know going in that the cameras I buy are cheap and won't be very good.|0
Very short battery life, and then the camera just shuts off, doesn't even close the lens if you're in the middle of a picture.|1
Very annoying.|0
Every photo comes pre-captioned with text, and this can be a time-wasting irritation when using your photos somewhere.|1
I have to delete each caption individually when I use them in a Word Press website.|0
I haven't found a way to change or remove the caption feature, even after reading the online manual.|0
Photos are what you expect.|0
Yeah, my phone is way better, but as I said I don't like to use it for work because my hands are often dirty, or paint-y, or resin-y, and I'm not going to ruin my phone that way.|0
I only use the Kodak camera for work, and would hate to try and use it in the real world.|0
So the long and the short is that this camera takes pictures that are adequate if you're just doing some sort of rough documentation, but not for family, vacations, or anything in the real world.|0
I bought it because it's cheap, and I'd had enough of some of the other brands I've tried that continually failed, so I refused to further support those camera manufacturers.|0
Perhaps I should just buy a cheap smartphone with no calling or data plan simply for the camera use?|0
Goes through batteries like popcorn.|0
Batteries go dead after several days without it being used.|1
Less than adequate memory.|1
Waste of money.|0
When using this camera, after only a few minutes or or even less, like under ten minutes, my camera kept showing on the screen that the battery was exhausted: even though the batteries were brand new.|0
So i bought a new pack of batteries while walking, and i put a new pair of batteries into the camera and proceeded to happily take photos; and after about two or three photos the camera said battery exhausted and many times the battery symbol would appear low or empty when using this camera, (and i had camera flash off) and no difference in battery life!|1
The battery still kept dying quickly!|0
You can't have any fun with this camera as far as going to a Museum, (which i did yesterday) and taking photos.|0
The camera kept dying on me and after short use... turning off by itself.|1
This camera has many on screen features which seem cool, but the battery life for this camera is terrible, and therefore makes this camera useless!|1
Because of this camera, i may not trust or buy Kodak cameras as much as i use to.|0
I didn't expect a camera to work like this from Kodak, which has been my favorite brand for years.|0
This camera is a waste of hard earned money.|0
I bought this camera for my 19-year-old son to use on his 2-year religious mission in South America.|0
Emails and pictures attached to his emails are my only contact with him.|0
After only one month away, his last email told me that his camera will no longer turn on.|1
It was not dropped or damaged in any way.|0
The return window is closed.|0
I wouldn't be able to get it back from South America anyway.|0
This mom is very sad.|0
All I wanted was a way to see my son in pictures.|0
Just O.K.|0
It hesitates too long between the time the button is pushed and the picture is taken.|1
I take a lot of pictures of wild life and birds and have missed many good shots because the subject moves before its completed.|0
Also the zoom is in an awkward position; not on top so that you have to move the camera away to zoom, once you've focused.|1
Plus it doesn't move smooth and is hard to adjust.|1
Advertised as an easy to use camera.|0
Buttons are tiny.|1
Not elderly friendly at all.|0
Photos are decent.|0
ok for quick pics.|0
Not good for close up photos.|1
Was hoping to continue using AA batteries without having to spend a bunch of money on a Canon.|0
Problem with this camera is it's ability of very close-up photo's.|0
Everything else seems ok.|0
Not a good option for detail close-ups.|0
Battery consumption is gigantic!|1
All my pictures come out looking blue.|0
This camera is a Micky mouse camera I bought it to give it away as a gift but.|0
Wold not give it I will buy one at Walmart that not a a camera like this.|0
I'm very disappointed|0
Listing of battery type is very confusing.|0
Just because one listing has rechargeable battery type, it seems it doesn't come with that type.|0
Now that I figured out you can use rechargeable type, I can't figure out if it can be charged while it's in the camera.|0
This information is very important.|0
Since it's so vague I should give them one star.|0
Get with the program Kodak!|0
It takes a very blurry picture|1
My iPhone 6s+ takes better photos, much quicker too.|0
However, if you must have a digital camera and you are looking for an affordable camera, this product is an option.|0
You must buy an additional memory card as the camera does not have much storage space.|0
Takes decent pictures but we use this for work.|0
Our technicians take these out on the job site.|0
The batteries die insanely fast.|0
The first day using it they had to switch the batteries 3 TIMES!|1
We normally don't even change the batteries for a few days maybe a week.|0
Will not buy again and regret buying it.|0
The camera arrived without the memory card.|0
It's pretty useless without it.|0
I was able to take three pictures before it ran out of memory.|1
It eats up batteries way too quickly!|1
Invest in rechargeable batteries for this.|0
Also, you can only delete photos ONE AT A TIME.|0
If you want to delete many, you have to actually plug it into the computer to mass delete.|0
I may just invest in a better camera.|0
Sucks the energy out of batteries like a leech.|1
I rated it a 1 star because the battery life did not meet my expectations.|0
When I turned the camera on, the battery life drained within a matter of seconds.|1
This is why I rated this Kodak camera a 1 star.|0
I am very unhappy with the camera but I think it is just because I can't really learn how to use it.|0
Not as simple as I expected.|0
Nice - nothing fancy.|0
Battery life is a little shorter than I would like.|1
But good photos.|0
It takes pictures, so it's getting 2 stars because it works.|0
Pictures are easily blurry with even small movements, and the camera burns through batteries.|1
Although the price was considerably discounted compared with other digital cameras with the similar functions, the photos are mediocre. I guess you get what you pay for.|0
AWFUL camera I am sorry but I am extremely UNSATISFIED with this camera.|0
The screen is so small that I can barely make out the picture.|1
I am so disappointed because I bought this camera for an event and I missed out on pictures because the camera is NOT user friendly.|1
I had to take pics with my cellular phone.|0
I like Kodak very much but this model is horrible.|0
The camera is so tiny and it kept telling me that the memory is full when I barely took any pictures.|1
Save your money please, i may give this to my 8 year old to play with.|0
Nice, light camera for travel.|0
This is my third camera in the Canon PowerShot line, I also have the S2IS and SX10IS.|0
Useless in low light situations.|1
Returned this camera because of the extremely poor viewfinder.|1
I am very satisfied.|0
Beyond expectations!|0
For $138 it takes better pics than my $300 Cannon.|0
The only con I could come up was that you can't manually adjust the shutter speed of the camera.|1
Then stopped reading memory cards.|1
But focusing far away Is a issue.|1
Awesome zoom with crisp pictures.|0
Low light performance.|1
Slow shutter speed.|1
No optical viewfinder.|0
I did have one problem with the camera, the battery that came with it refused to take a charge.|1
It can take pictures even in the darkest place. |0
As noted by many others, the LCD viewscreen is very hard to see when shooting in bright sunlight.|1
Yup, I picked the right camera for me.|0
The EF-S zoom lens that comes with it is rather slow and a bit disappointing in picture quality.|1
Had to send it to canon to have it repaired, pins missing in the flash memory bay.|1
Camera didn't work with flash.|1
The controls are NOT intuitive, the ability to do simple things (like turn off the flash) are so archaically done that we only take this out if it's an outside shot or every other camera and smart phone is gone.|1
The instant I went to click shots of the starting gate it shut off.|1
My daughter was very upset and disappointed.|0
Customer service was good!|0
The spare battery they included was dead and won't charge.|1
I was shopping for a decent DSLR film camera, and saw this camera.|0
The auto-focus struggles with alarming frequency. |1
The LCD screen stopped working after a little over a year. |1
I have owned the Digital Rebel XT many months ago and have been mostly pleased. |0
The new camera has performed beautifully with no hint of any problems.|0
I've owned a Canon A-1 for 23 years and it's seen a lot of use.|0
This totally amazes me...!|0
Came with a broken lens.|0
it's ok.|0
The camera works pretty well easy to use.|0
The camera takes quality photos, and I will continue to use it often.|0
The camera is a great value for the money.|0
Excellent beginner to intermediate setup.|0
No audio jack makes this camera a waste of time.|0
This camera is good for someone like me, who doesn't need anything spectacular.|0
Neither lens zoomed for close ups. |1
Very disappointed.|0
The lens received with the camera was tampered. |0
We got this camera for our real estate office and we take lots of pictures. |0
no slot for a memory card.|1
Couldn't see anything on the screen.|0
no slot for memory stick, so when the battery drains (and it dies fast!) all the pictures are lost.|1
DO NOT BUY THIS.|0
Eats batteries after 1 second says "needs new batteries".|1
No flash and the pictures are awful.|1
Camera did not work, all pictures came out extremely dark, and could not tell what was taken. |1
I thought it would be great for my five year old as her first digital camera. |0
Sadly have to return.|0
USB cord was missing, and battery life is only a few shots then must be replaced. |1
Would buy again.|0
My daughter loves it.|0
No way to recharge the batteries.|1
Very easy to use, small, great for a gift for older kids.|0
Battery cover broke immediately after putting in batteries.|1
Terrible camera!|0
awful cheap camera, cheap plastic, awful image and didnt worked properly.|1
Takes very low quality pics.|1
Can not take a memory card.|0
It's cute and love the color.|0
This one has blurry and grainy pictures and does not hod many pictures.|1
Terrible quality, delay in time you take picture before it is actually captured.|1
despite putting new batteries in the camera it said the battery was empty.|1
Can't focus the lens on anything.|1
no SD slot.|0
Software would not download into Windows 10.|1
Display is fuzzy and colors are overly bright and not realistic.|1
OMG, I wish I had read these reviews before I bought this for my 8 year old daughter.|0
It's trash|0
The camera only holds about 10 pictures before it is full and does not have the option for a memory card, very disappointing. |1
The picture is blurry.|1
The batteries become very hot.|1
I am throwing it way it's total a trash product.|0
no storage for pics or option to increase storage with a card|1
How can you sell this?|0
This was not what I expected.|0
I know that it's cheap and I guess you get what you pay for.|0
The screen is so small and pixelated that you can't see the picture that you took.|1
Batteries drain really quick even when off.|1
Images come out blurry.|1
The screen was broken and wouldn't show any picture.|1
Forgot to check the reviews before I made this purchase.|0
From the review and pictues, it seemed to be a decent camera.|0
When its accidentally dropped it erases all of the pics stored.|1
Didn't meet my expectation.|0
I cannot express in words my extreme disappointment with this camera. |0
How I wish I had never wasted my money!|0
ok for quick pics.|0
Advertised as an easy to use camera.|0
All my pictures come out looking "blue".|1
Battery consumption is gigantic!|1
This is a utility camera. |0
If you need something you don't care much about for work, or basic use, it's OK.|0
Very short battery life, and then the camera just shuts off, doesn't even close the lens if you're in the middle of a picture.|1
I takes a good picture for what I need and a zoom.|0
Pictures are easily blurry with even small movements, and the camera burns through batteries.|1
For the money it's a good utility camera capable of taking relatively good pictures.|0
No problems with the camera.|0
I don't recommend this product.|0
very easy to use.|0
This is a great inexpensive camera.|0
Point and shoot mode stays pretty sharp and focused.|0
I take a lot of pictures and thought the AA batteries that could be recharged would be a plus.|0
Bad pictures under low light.|1
slow shutter lag.|1
Software with camera does not load pictures correctly.|1
I was looking for something simple and easy to use.|0
The video is great.|0
Zoom lens didn't work well.|1
The camera would probably be fine.|0
Camera is small, nice looking and I love the larger screen to view my photos.|0
I must admit that for the price this camera was more than I would have expected. |0
The wifi features are very clunky and cumbersome to use.|1
Doesn't focus very well.|1
Very hard to find the subject in the daylight.|1
Slow shutter time.|1
Prints are not sharp.|1
The photos this camera took when zoomed in even a little bit come out way too soft and do not look very well focused. |1
It performs worse in color, distance, and clarity of pixels when zoomed in. Same for video.|1
Poor stabilization at high zoom.|1
Returned the camera - blurry pictures if the subject isn't standing perfectly still.|1
I gave 3 star because of setup WiFi is a pain in the neck.|1
It reverts to 'movie' mode from still picture mode on it's own.|1
Also the wifi function is mystifyingly difficult to operate. |1
White-balance was completely off.|1
At first really loved the camera but after a 3-4 uses the lens protecter jammed.|1
Blurry pictures and video.|1
To use the flash, you have to manually pop-up the flash unit.|1
Hard to take a picture that is not blurry.|1
The camera itself is good for people who don't want to fiddle with settings. |0
I used the Canon PowerShot SX600 HS for 3 weeks.|0
Focuses poorly.|1
Does not have correct usb for loading pictures on computer.|1
Pictures look fuzzy or blurred on camera screen.|1
The picture quality is terrible.|1
Buttons did not work.|1
It always focuses on the ground, despite where I move the center object.|1
The pictures don't come out centered. |1
The photos come out very off centered from what it looks like while actually taking the photo.|1
It sucked..worked for a few pictures and broke..waste of $.|0
Poor quality focus on camera. |1
Photo quality is less than expected.|1
It doesn't focus the way it should.|1
never ordered. |0
The shutter button only works half the time. |1
Disappointed.|0
cannot visualize the picture in the digital viewer. |1
This camera lasted about 20minutes before the lock to hold the batteries in broke, then shortly after it just stopped working. |1
display quality is very poor.|1
I bought two of these Sticker Wizards for Christmas for my Granddaughters. |0
Please don't purchase this I was very disappointed and returned it.|0
We could never even get the camera to boot up sufficiently to take photos, no matter how many new batteries we sacrificed to it..|1
Battery door broke off almost immediately. |1
Not the best quality, but perfect for my eight-year-old.|0
I recorded a video with sound, but the sound quality is non-existent. |1
I bought it because it was cheap. |0
videos are very grainy to the point people are unrecognizable even on the computer. |1
DONT BUY THIS SAVE YOUR MONEY!!! |0
It would not stay on and batteries needed replace every couple minutes. |1
Will never buy anything from Vivitar again.|0
The picture isn't very clear and you really can't use zoom at all or the picture is blurry!|1
it works. |0
Garbage do not buy!!|0
has terrible video quality in both low light and daylight conditions.|1
there is no protection over the lens.|1
The flash is not adequate in the dark. |1
As soon as you turn off the power all changes you made in the setting goes back to defult.|1
Quality better than quantity.|0
Awful camera.|0
batteries wear out after 30 minutes of use. |1
Keeps saying low power and turning off. |1
First of all, the photos are very bad!|1
I was limited to taking about 20 pictures before it would time out on me and refuse to come back on. |1
only took 3 pictures and the camera said I was out of memory.|1
The flash wouldn't work at all! |1
The zoom distorted the images...|1
I didn't use it. |0
I didn't read the information to see that it was a used camera that came with nothing|0
Pop-up flash stopped working after very minimal and careful use.|1
Takes very good snapshots........lightwieght, good zoom capabilites.|0
nonresponsive on/off button|1
the fisheye lens whiting out the image. |1
90% of my shots were out of focus.|1
Simply refuses to autofocus in full zoom when bird watching, will always pick a foreground object like a leaf or blade of grass.|1
Useless in low light situations.|1
The flash unit does not automatically pop up when it is needed, rather has to be manually lifted before use.|1
I have to say I am bitterly disappointed with this camera.|0
When zooming in with the camera on the sport symbol, the camera is continually zooming in and out and will not stay focused so all your action shots are blurry. |1
the lens get stuck so many times. |1
the screen regularly froze.|1
