I'm not sure why this camera is getting such glowing reviews.|0
As a point-and-shoot for daytime vacation photos, this camera is perfectly serviceable.|0
At nighttime, or under any kind of challenging conditions (such as a concert), the camera is SLOW as molasses to take pictures, and the pictures are often washed out or out of focus.|1
On vacation in Europe I took (no joke) 50+ pictures of the Grand Place in Brussels at night, and NOT ONE came out decently - all were extremely grainy or horribly out of focus, or both.|1
However, pictures I took with my cell phone came out fine (given that it was a 5MP camera on a $79 phone).|0
Also, pictures I took with my GF's *cheaper* Canon P&S looked fine.|0
So it's not entirely me.|0
I also took this camera with me to a recent CHVRCHES concert: despite being less than 30 feet from the stage, the pics I took with this camera are AWFUL - the pics taken with the 8MP camera on my (new) phone look a hundred times better.|0
It's almost as if the firmware is somehow off on this camera or something.|0
All I know is, this is my fourth digital P&S camera, and this is the worst one BY FAR - even the godawful HP digital camera I owned back in 2002 took better low-light pictures than this camera.|0
Also, the battery latch has a nasty habit of popping open in my pocket, something that's never once happened with the HP and Canon cameras I've owned in the past.|1
I read on an article that this is a good camera.|0
Nope.|0
I bought this camera for my trip to Thailand but it takes such bad pictures to the point where I just leave it behind.|0
I ended up using my phone because it takes much better picture.|0
Any slight movement when taking the picture of result in a lifetime of missed memories because the picture will come out very blurry.|1
Such an awful camera.|0
I am never going to buy a cheap camera again.|0
I guess I could give this to some or donate it.|0
First photo is with Sony Second photo is with New Canon SX 520 HS $89 (16 megapixel) Third photo is with old Canon Powershot SD 100 (7.1 megapixel) , my dog moved during the third photo I usually only purchase items after reading multiple reviews.|0
I was tricked by the amount of good vs. poor reviews on this camera.|0
Even though the specs are pretty good 20.1 megapixel, optical zoom, etc, the pictures produced were less than ideal.|0
It was far inferior to the pictures taken with my Canon Powershot purchased 10 years ago.|0
That camera had much lower specs.|0
Without the flash, the pictures are extremely blurry.|1
With the blinding flash (which I was afraid would cause my 1 yr old niece retinal damage, so I decided to stop taking pictures during her birthday party :( ) the pictures were only slightly better.|1
I even tried taking pictures outside when it was bright and sunny but that still did not help with my picture quality.|0
I'm not a photography expert or anything, which is why I rely on specs and online reviews. |0
All I want is a point and shoot camera that worked maybe slightly better than my old camera.|0
I should have checked other review website before deciding to purchase this camera.|0
I regret purchasing this $89 paperweight.|0
I tried returning this product or trading it in.|0
Apparently no website, including Amazon trade in, will accept this product.|0
I know why.|0
Ugh.|0
Returned item, extremely limited menu options, focus is slow so it doesn't take pictures fast enough (my phone was faster), build quality is very cheap I thought It was going to break when opening the battery hatch, and to top it off the charging cable is SONY PROPRIETARY, Why on earth is it not USB??|1
Terrible for travel if all of your gear is USB...except for this darn thing.|0
I've had a lot of Sony cameras in the past and they were great..but this model is a joke.|0
I had a similar Sony camera that gave out after almost ten years of use.|0
I wanted something as similar as possible to my old one, and this looked, on paper, to fit the bill.|0
However, in ten years the quality has gone downhill.|0
This is more shoddily made, and the picture quality was worse despite a higher pixel count.|1
It's small and portable, but the picture quality was very low (compared to the similar camera I had owned and other cameras produced today.)|0
The shutter speed was awful, so I was consistently frustrated taking pictures of family and friends--which is why I bought the camera!|1
If you really don't expect much, it's ok, but spending a little more--or, as I did, spending *LESS* on an older model--yielded much higher quality photos.|0
I've had it a little over a year, now the Image Stabilization has Parkinson's..|0
It's saying there is shaking even when on something stable, and ADDS massive blur to the picture.|1
Terrific.|0
I might use it once every few months, maybe took a few hundred pictures with it.|0
Oh well, guess it's a cheap throwaway (even though $100 is pretty damn steep for that).|0
I attached a pic of what it now looks like when I take a picture as still as I can be.|0
We've owned several Sony point and shoots over the years.|0
This one was a big disappointment.|0
We figured that the price was so low due to the improvement in phone cameras.|0
But this was cheap because it is built rather cheap.|1
The photo quality was average to poor, and it just feels like a $100 camera that it is.|0
We don't use it anymore, and either use our phones, or take our Nikon DLSR with us.|0
This particular Sony is sitting the bench.|0
I don't recommend unless you are looking for a cheap extra camera and photo quality is not that important to you.|0
Lasted only several weeks of indoor use, then error on power-up.|1
Warranty claim took more than 2 months to process (actually, it's still not resolved because I'm still waiting for the buy back check Sony promised).|0
I had to call Sony after many weeks of no status updates.|0
Then they say they can't fix it and will refund my money since Sony can't provide that same model as a replacement anymore.|0
While it was working, picture quality was not very good, but I didn't expect much given the price.|1
I am a real estate appraiser and I don't like to carry a big, expensive, or heavy camera.|0
I take all my photos in the lowest resolution for internet transport and I take lots of photos both inside and outside in every condition from very low to bright light.|0
My last camera was a cheap Samsung which I bought at Costco for like $100 and it worked great until the battery/SD card hinged cover broke off.|0
I'm very disappointed in this Sony camera.|0
It is almost impossible to get a good photo inside or outside.|0
Every photo comes out dark and I have to lighten it which makes it look washed out.|1
I will be returning it and buying a Canon based on this link [...]and the recommendation.|0
Found one here on Amazon for a little more than this piece of junk cost me. Hope it works!|0
Bought this to replace my 6 year old Fuji Finepix which had done sterling service, but was beginning to look it's age and photos were looking a bit blurry in comparison to those taken on my phone.|0
Thinking that great strides must have been made since buying the Fuji, I read up on all the point & shoot models, and mainly due to the many glowing reviews decided on this one.|0
I really wish I hadn't bothered.|0
As mentioned by other reviewers, the picture quality is acceptable for close ups but the zoom is basically useless; and the painfully slow shutter speed means that you end up with a load of photos you don't want because they've all been taken about 10 seconds too late!|1
Picture quality is really no better than it's predecessor and at least it took the pics I wanted.|0
On the plus side it's very light and slim and fits easily into a pocket or bag, but I think this will be heading for the charity box.|0
in taking video: blurs the video every few seconds.|1
totally unexplained...there was no movement distortion as it was stabilized on a tripod.|0
Happened every time video was shot.|0
Of course it was returned.|0
I used this a few times for biking.|0
Great for still shots, not so great for moving/action shots.|0
Even the still shots sometimes look a little crumby.|1
The only advantage this camera has over an iphone 6s is the zoom quality.|0
I've actually resorted back to using my phone for its ease of use.|0
I returned the first camera because it stopped working after one day.|0
It was replaced in September and although most of my pictures were out of focus, I assumed I was the problem and needed to learn more.|0
Had to postpone using it because of family member's heath needs until the past week.|0
Over the Christmas holidays, I took many pictures at family gatherings.|0
Almost every picture is blurred and has to be discarded.|1
It is too late to get a solution and there seems to be no solution offered.|0
This camera is absolutely horrible!|0
Yes, it can fit in my pocket, which is nice.|0
Yes, it doesn't require batteries.|0
But that's as far as the good qualities go.|0
All the pictures I take are dark, dingy, and blurry.|1
I've read the manual and changed the settings - nothing improves the crappy quality of the photos.|0
I'm not asking for anything super fancy or HD, I just want a decent, non-blurry picture of my family on vacation.|0
The video is horrible as well. I like that there is no time limit on how long the video can be, but it doesn't matter when the image goes in and out of focus the entire video.|1
This was the biggest waste of money!!!|0
I'm so disappointed.|0
I hate this camera so much that I wouldn't even re-sell to somebody at a reduced price.|0
